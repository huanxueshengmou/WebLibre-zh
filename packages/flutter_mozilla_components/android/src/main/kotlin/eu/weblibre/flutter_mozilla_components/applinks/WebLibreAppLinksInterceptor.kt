/**
 * The WebLibre-owned §2.4 interception tail (APP_LINKS_OWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 5). Replaces
 * Mozilla AC's `AppLinksInterceptor` + `AppLinksFeature` + `AppLinksCancelRetryMiddleware` on the
 * synchronous `RequestInterceptor.onLoadRequest` path.
 *
 * Structural guards (PWA/TWA, sandbox capture, `weblibre://`, FxA) already ran in
 * [eu.weblibre.flutter_mozilla_components.interceptor.AppRequestInterceptor] before this is called;
 * this tail owns steps 2–8: navigation eligibility, resolution/sanitisation ([ExternalAppResolver]),
 * the pure [AppLinkClassifier] decision, and its execution (auto-launch, validated fallback, or a
 * pending prompt). Policy comes from the profile-scoped [AppLinkPolicyStore]; prompts land in the
 * profile-scoped [PendingAppLinkStore]. It never denies a load and re-issues the same load.

     * Issue [fallbackUrl] as the replacement load, or keep the current page when this tab has
     * already been sent to the same fallback inside the window (§2.7,
     * [PendingAppLinkStore.claimFallbackIssue]).
     *
     * Without the claim this is an unbounded reload loop on any page that re-fires its `intent:`
     * URL every time its own `browser_fallback_url` page loads — Google Maps place links do, so
     * under `never` (or with the target app absent) the tab reloaded roughly once a second for as
     * long as it stayed open. Nothing on the *fallback's* own load can catch that: the load that
     * regenerates the loop arrives under the `intent:` URL, not the fallback URL.
     *
     * The claim is keyed on the URL native hands out rather than the one that comes back, so a
     * fallback rewritten in flight (a redirect dropping a campaign parameter) is still recognised —
     * and on origin + path rather than the whole URL, because the same page grows a query parameter
     * on every bounce. See [PendingAppLinkStore.claimFallbackIssue] for both bounds.
     *
     * The flags are explicit, and both differences from the AC default are deliberate:
     * - no `EXTERNAL`, which would push Gecko through a content-process switch and surface a
     *   transient `about:blank` for a page that is not arriving from another app;
     * - no `LOAD_FLAGS_BYPASS_LOAD_URI_DELEGATE`, which the AC default *does* set. A fallback is a
     *   page-supplied URL that has passed no structural check yet, and skipping the delegate would
     *   take `AppRequestInterceptor`'s sandbox-capture, PWA/TWA and `weblibre://` guards out of its
     *   path — a sandbox tab could reach the live web through an `intent:` link's fallback. The
     *   re-entry map is what keeps the returning load from being re-classified as an app link.
