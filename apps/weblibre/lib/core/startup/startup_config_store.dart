/// construct this store ad hoc wherever they need it — queueing a backup, a
/// delete, reading the prompt mode — so an instance-scoped lock would serialize
/// nothing between two of them, and an instance-scoped cache would keep serving a
/// value another instance had already superseded. Both are therefore keyed by
/// path, which also keeps a test that points two stores at different temporary
/// directories independent.

/// Serialization is per isolate, which is all this can offer: a second isolate
/// writing the same file is prevented upstream, by the profile-access lease.
