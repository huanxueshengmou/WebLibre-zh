 *
 * **A request's lifetime is deliberately not derived from navigation.** Three attempts to infer
 * "the user has left the page this prompt belongs to" from the [mozilla.components.browser.state.store.BrowserStore]
 * action stream all failed the same way, because every available signal is *per document* while a
 * single user-visible navigation spans several:
 * - comparing the committed URL's host to the request's anchor killed a banner on its own redirect
 *   chain (`youtu.be` → `youtube.com`, shortener → destination) and killed a modal on the commit of
 *   the very load it had interrupted — leaving a denied navigation with no dialog to un-stall it;
 * - counting load starts ([mozilla.components.browser.state.action.ContentAction.UpdateLoadingStateAction])
 *   dismissed banners seconds in, because each redirected document starts its own load;
 * - settling on idle only moved that to the first `onPageStop`, which multi-document pages reach
 *   long before the user is done with them.
 *
 * So navigation is not consulted at all. A request ends when the user answers it, when its tab
 * closes, when a newer banner for the same tab replaces it, or when it expires ([BANNER_EXPIRY_MS]
 * for the passive banner, [REQUEST_EXPIRY_MS] for a modal that is holding a navigation). The
 * residual risk — a banner outliving the page it was raised on — is bounded by that expiry and is
 * strictly safer than the alternatives: a lingering banner still names its target and still opens
 * exactly that link, whereas the invalidation heuristics produced prompts that silently did
 * nothing. Do not reintroduce URL- or load-state-derived invalidation without a signal that is
 * per *navigation* rather than per document.

     * may be issued at all. App-promotion pages re-fire their `intent:` URL on every load of their
     * own `browser_fallback_url` page (Google Maps place links do), so issuing the fallback
     * unconditionally reloads that page for as long as the tab is open. The re-entry map cannot
     * catch that on its own: the load that regenerates the loop arrives under the `intent:` URL.
     *

     * the web provides:
     * 1. per [fallbackIdentity]: the first claim in a window wins, repeats are refused;
     * 2. per tab: at most [fallbackIssueBudget] fallback loads per budget window, whatever their
     *    identity — this one holds even against a page that mutates its fallback URL on every
     *    bounce, which is exactly how the identity bound was first defeated.
     *
     * A refused claim pushes both windows out, so a page firing on a timer cannot walk around
     * either by waiting. The escape hatch is a user-initiated navigation
     * ([clearFallbackIssuedForTab]), not the passage of time.
