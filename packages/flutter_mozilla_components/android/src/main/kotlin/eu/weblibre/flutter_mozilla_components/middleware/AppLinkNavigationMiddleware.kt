/**
 * Observes the [BrowserStore] and drives [PendingAppLinkStore] tab teardown and suppression
 * clearing (APP_LINKS_OWN_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §2.6):
 *
 * - tab close / Custom Tab removal invalidates the tab's pending requests and suppression, and
 *   tells the owning surface to re-query so no dead prompt is left on screen. Bulk closes name no
 *   tab, so they reconcile against the surviving tabs after the reducer ([retainLiveTabs]);
 * - a new user-initiated/direct navigation (omnibar, bookmark, typed URL — which dispatch a
 *   `LoadUrlAction`) clears the tab's suppression and its fallback-issue claims. In-page
 *   redirects do not dispatch these actions — nor does the interceptor's own
 *   `InterceptionResponse.Url`, which the engine session loads directly — so the redirect-loop
 *   defences stay intact and the user keeps a way to ask for the fallback again. A load we issued
 *   ourselves to release a held prompt is exempt; see [clearForUserNavigation].
 *
 * It deliberately does **not** invalidate prompts on navigation: see the [PendingAppLinkStore]
 * KDoc for the three per-document signals that were tried and why none of them can express
 * "the user left this page".
